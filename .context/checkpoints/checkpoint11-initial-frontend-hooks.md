# Checkpoint 11 - Frontend Hooks and TypeScript Types

**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Previous Checkpoint**: checkpoint10-ai-service.md  
**Next AI Action**: Create authentication components (Login/Register) and set up routing

---

## üéØ Quick Start for Next AI

> **YOUR FIRST TASK**: Install frontend dependencies and test the dev server:
> ```bash
> cd frontend && npm install
> npm run dev
> ```
> Then start creating the authentication components in `frontend/src/pages/`

## üìç Current State Summary

All React hooks are implemented for complete API integration. TypeScript types are properly organized and match the backend Pydantic schemas perfectly. The frontend is ready for UI component development with full type safety and optimal state management using React Query.

---

## üìÇ Critical Files Created

### frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.ts
- **Purpose**: Authentication state management
- **Features**:
  - Register new users
  - OAuth2 login (form-urlencoded)
  - Get current user
  - Auto token refresh (25 min intervals)
  - Logout with cleanup

### frontend/src/hooks/useUpload.ts
- **Purpose**: File upload management
- **Features**:
  - Single/multiple file uploads
  - Progress tracking
  - List uploads with filters
  - Delete uploads
  - Auto-refresh processing status
  - Metadata fetching

### frontend/src/hooks/useSearch.ts
- **Purpose**: Semantic search functionality
- **Features**:
  - Natural language search
  - Find similar uploads
  - Search suggestions (debounced)
  - Batch search
  - Search history tracking
  - Result grouping helpers

### frontend/src/types/models.ts
- **Purpose**: Core data models
- **Contents**: User, Upload, SearchResult, etc.

### frontend/src/types/api.ts
- **Purpose**: API request/response types
- **Contents**: All API-specific interfaces

### frontend/src/types/index.ts
- **Purpose**: Central type exports
- **Features**: Helper types, validation constants

## ‚úÖ What I Accomplished

### Completed
- [x] Created comprehensive React hooks
  - useAuth with full JWT flow
  - useUpload with progress tracking
  - useSearch with advanced features
- [x] Organized TypeScript types
  - Separated models from API types
  - Added helper types and utilities
  - File validation constants
- [x] React Query integration
  - Optimal caching strategies
  - Mutation/query patterns
  - Auto-refresh logic
- [x] Added lodash for debouncing

### Architecture Decisions
1. **React Query**: For server state management
2. **Zustand**: For client state (auth store)
3. **Type Organization**: Separate files for models vs API
4. **Hook Patterns**: Return objects with clear naming

---

## üéØ Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Create Authentication Pages
```tsx
// frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx
// frontend/src/pages/Register.tsx
- Use the useAuth hook
- Form validation
- Error handling
```

### 2. Set Up App Routing
```tsx
// frontend/src/App.tsx
- Protected routes
- Public routes
- Auth redirects
```

### 3. Create Main Layout
```tsx
// frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx
- Navigation bar
- User menu
- Responsive design
```

### 4. Build Upload Component
```tsx
// frontend/src/components/FileUpload.tsx
- Drag and drop
- Progress bars
- File validation
```

---

## üí° Important Context

### Hook Usage Examples
```tsx
// Using auth hook
const { login, isLoggingIn, loginError } = useAuth()

// Using upload hook  
const { uploadFile, uploadProgress } = useUpload()
const { data: uploads } = useUploadsList({ page: 1 })

// Using search hook
const { search, isSearching, searchData } = useSearch()
```

### File Validation
Constants are exported from types:
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE`: 100MB
- `ALLOWED_IMAGE_TYPES`: jpg, png, webp, etc.
- `ALLOWED_VIDEO_TYPES`: mp4, mov, etc.

### API Client Setup
The `apiClient` in `frontend/src/api/client.ts`:
- Adds auth token to requests
- Handles 401 errors
- Base URL from env

---

## üß™ Testing the Hooks

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Test in Browser Console
```javascript
// After setting up QueryClient provider
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks'
// Use in a component
```

---

## üìã Dependencies Added
- ‚úÖ lodash (for debouncing)
- ‚úÖ @types/lodash

All other dependencies were already in package.json.

## ü§ñ Message to Next AI

Excellent foundation! The hooks are production-ready with:
- ‚úÖ Full TypeScript coverage
- ‚úÖ React Query for optimal performance
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking for uploads
- ‚úÖ Debounced search suggestions
- ‚úÖ Auto token refresh

**Your immediate priorities**:
1. Create Login and Register pages using the auth hook
2. Set up React Router with protected routes
3. Build the main layout component
4. Add React Query provider to main.tsx

The hooks handle all the complex logic - you just need to build the UI! All types are properly defined, so you'll get full IntelliSense support.

Pro tip: Start with authentication flow to test the hooks end-to-end. The backend is running and ready to accept requests!

Let's build an amazing UI! üöÄ‚ú®
