# Checkpoint 12 - Frontend UI Foundation

**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Previous Checkpoint**: checkpoint11-initial-frontend-hooks.md  
**Next AI Action**: Build the Upload component with drag-and-drop, then implement Search functionality

---

## 🎯 Quick Start for Next AI

> **YOUR FIRST TASK**: Install dependencies and test the auth flow:
> ```bash
> cd frontend && npm install
> # Start frontend
> npm run dev
> 
> # In another terminal, start backend
> cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload
> ```
> Then visit http://localhost:5173 and test registration/login

## 📍 Current State Summary

Complete frontend infrastructure is now in place with React Query providers, routing with protected routes, full layout with navigation, and authentication pages. The app uses TypeScript files with separate CSS files as requested, maintaining clean separation of logic and styles.

---

## 📂 Critical Files Created

### Frontend Infrastructure
- **main.tsx**: React Query + Router providers configured
- **App.tsx**: Complete routing with protected/public routes
- **App.css**: Global styles with CSS variables

### Layout Component
- **components/Layout/Layout.tsx**: Full navigation bar with user menu
- **components/Layout/Layout.css**: Responsive nav styles

### Authentication Pages
- **pages/Login/Login.tsx**: OAuth2-compliant login form
- **pages/Login/Login.css**: Shared auth page styles
- **pages/Register/Register.tsx**: Registration with password validation
- **pages/Register/Register.css**: Extended auth styles

### Placeholder Pages
- **pages/Home/Home.tsx**: Landing page
- **pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx**: User dashboard (basic)
- **pages/Upload/Upload.tsx**: Upload page (placeholder)
- **pages/Search/Search.tsx**: Search page (placeholder)
- **pages/NotFound/NotFound.tsx**: 404 page

## ✅ What I Accomplished

### Completed
- [x] Set up React Query Provider with optimized defaults
  - 5 min stale time, 10 min cache time
  - Disabled refetch on window focus
  - Dev tools included
- [x] Implemented routing structure
  - Protected routes with auth check
  - Public routes with redirect if authenticated
  - Loading states during auth check
- [x] Created full layout with navigation
  - Responsive design (mobile/desktop)
  - User dropdown menu
  - Active link highlighting
- [x] Built authentication pages
  - Login with OAuth2 form-urlencoded
  - Register with real-time password validation
  - Success/error message handling
- [x] Established CSS architecture
  - CSS variables for theming
  - Dark mode support ready
  - Separate CSS files per component

### Architecture Decisions
1. **CSS Pattern**: Separate .css files with CSS variables for consistency
2. **Auth Flow**: OAuth2 standard with form-urlencoded login
3. **Route Protection**: Wrapper components for auth logic
4. **Layout**: Sticky nav, max-width content container

## 🎯 Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Build Upload Component
```tsx
// frontend/src/components/FileUpload/FileUpload.tsx

```tsx
// frontend/src/components/MediaGrid/MediaGrid.tsx
- Display uploads with thumbnails
- Processing status indicators
- Click to view details
```

### 3. Implement Search Interface
```tsx
// Update frontend/src/pages/Search/Search.tsx

```

### 4. Build Upload Details Modal
```tsx
// frontend/src/components/UploadModal/UploadModal.tsx
- Full size preview
- Metadata display
- AI-generated description
- Delete option
```

## 💡 Important Context

### CSS Architecture
Using CSS variables in `:root` for consistent theming:
- Colors: primary, secondary, danger, success
- Backgrounds: bg-primary, bg-secondary, bg-tertiary
- Text: text-primary, text-secondary, text-tertiary
- Transitions: transition-fast, transition-base, transition-slow

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers → Redirected to login with success message
2. User logs in → OAuth2 token endpoint → Dashboard
3. Token stored in localStorage → Auto-refresh every 25 min
4. 401 response → Clear auth → Redirect to login

### Component Structure
```
pages/
  ComponentName/
    ComponentName.tsx
    ComponentName.css
    
components/
  ComponentName/
    ComponentName.tsx
    ComponentName.css
```

## 🧪 Testing the Current State

### 1. Test Registration
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/register
2. Try invalid passwords to see validation
3. Register with valid credentials
4. Verify redirect to login with success message

### 2. Test Login
1. Login with registered credentials
2. Verify redirect to dashboard
3. Check navigation appears
4. Test user dropdown menu

### 3. Test Navigation
1. Click through nav items
2. Verify active states
3. Test mobile menu (resize browser)
4. Logout and verify redirect
