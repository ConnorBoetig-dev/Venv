# Checkpoint 3 - Backend Configuration Foundation

**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Previous Checkpoint**: checkpoint2-scaffolding.md  
**Next AI Action**: Implement base models and JWT authentication

---

## 🎯 Quick Start for Next AI

> **YOUR FIRST TASK**: Test database connection by running:
> ```bash
> cd backend && python -c "from database import db; import asyncio; asyncio.run(db.connect())"
> ```

---

## 📍 Current State Summary

Backend foundation is complete with configuration management and database connection pooling. The app can now load settings from environment variables and connect to PostgreSQL with pgvector support. Ready to build models and authentication on top of this foundation.

## 📂 Critical Files Created

### backend/config.py
- **Purpose**: Pydantic Settings for environment configuration
- **Key Features**:
  - Loads from `.env` files and environment variables
  - Validates all settings with proper types
  - Provides defaults for development
  - Validates API keys presence in production
  - Auto-creates upload directories
  - Cached singleton pattern with `get_settings()`

### backend/database.py  
- **Purpose**: Async PostgreSQL connection with pgvector
- **Key Features**:
  - Connection pooling with asyncpg
  - pgvector type registration
  - Transaction context managers
  - Vector similarity search helper
  - Index creation utilities
  - Global `db` instance for app-wide use

---

## ✅ What I Accomplished

### Completed
- [x] Created comprehensive settings management
  - All environment variables defined
  - Proper validation and defaults
  - Development vs production awareness
- [x] Implemented async database pooling
  - Min/max connections configurable
  - Automatic pgvector setup
  - Helper methods for common operations
- [x] Added vector search utilities
  - Similarity search with filters
  - Index creation helpers
  - Proper vector type handling

### Technical Decisions
1. **Raw asyncpg over SQLAlchemy**: Better performance for vector operations
2. **Settings validation**: Warn on insecure configs but don't block (availability > security for MVP)
3. **Connection pool sizing**: 10-20 connections default, adjustable via env
4. **Vector index type**: IVFFlat by default, HNSW option available

## 🎯 Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Create Base Model Class
```python
# In backend/models/base.py:
- BaseModel with id, created_at, updated_at
- Common CRUD operations
- Async query helpers
```

### 2. Implement Password Utilities
```python
# In backend/auth/password.py:
- Bcrypt hashing with 12 rounds
- Password verification
- Secure random token generation
```

### 3. Create User Model
```python
# In backend/models/user.py:
- User table with email, password_hash
- Registration/login methods
- Find by email/id helpers
```

### 4. Build JWT Authentication
```python
# In backend/auth/jwt_auth.py:
- Token creation with expiration
- Token validation and decoding
- get_current_user dependency
```

---

## 💡 Important Notes

### Environment Variables Set
From `.env.dev`:
- ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY (provided)
- ✅ GEMINI_API_KEY (provided) 
- ✅ SECRET_KEY (dev default)
- ✅ DATABASE_URL (Docker service)

### Vector Operations
The database is ready for pgvector operations:
- Embeddings stored as `vector(1536)`
- Cosine similarity operator: `<=>`
- Distance queries return similarity scores

### Connection Management
Always use context managers:
```python
async with db.acquire() as conn:
    # Single query
    
async with db.transaction() as conn:
    # Multiple queries in transaction
```

## 🤖 Message to Next AI

Great progress! The foundation is solid. We have:
1. **Config**: All settings centralized and validated
2. **Database**: Async pool ready with pgvector support

**Your priorities**:
1. Create the base model class that all models will inherit from
2. Get authentication working (password hashing → JWT)
3. Build the User model with proper async methods

Remember to use modern Python type hints (`str | None`) and keep all database operations in model classes following MVC pattern. The database helper methods in `database.py` will make your model implementations much cleaner.

Test the connection with Docker running to ensure everything works before building on top! 🚀
