# Checkpoint 4 - Core Models Implementation

**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Previous Checkpoint**: checkpoint3-backend-config.md  
**Next AI Action**: Implement authentication (password.py and jwt_auth.py)

---

## 🎯 Quick Start for Next AI

> **YOUR FIRST TASK**: Create the password hashing utilities in `backend/auth/password.py`
> Then implement JWT token management in `backend/auth/jwt_auth.py`

---

## 📍 Current State Summary

All core database models are implemented with full async support and MVC pattern compliance. The models use raw asyncpg for performance, PostgreSQL-generated UUIDs, and include comprehensive CRUD operations. Upload model has sophisticated vector search capabilities ready for AI integration.

## 📂 Critical Files Created

### backend/models/base.py
- **Purpose**: Base class for all models
- **Key Features**:
  - Common fields (id, created_at, updated_at)
  - CRUD operations (find_by_id, save, delete)
  - to_dict() for serialization
  - Table creation helpers

### backend/models/user.py
- **Purpose**: User authentication model
- **Key Features**:
  - Email/password storage (hash only)
  - Account activation/deactivation
  - Duplicate email prevention
  - Password update methods

### backend/models/upload.py
- **Purpose**: Media file uploads with AI
- **Key Features**:
  - Processing states: pending → analyzing → embedding → completed/failed
  - Vector similarity search
  - Metadata and error tracking
  - Batch operations for processing

### backend/models/__init__.py
- **Purpose**: Easy imports
- **Exports**: All models and enums

---

## ✅ What I Accomplished

### Completed
- [x] BaseModel with common CRUD operations
  - Async methods throughout
  - PostgreSQL UUID generation
  - Proper type hints everywhere
- [x] User model for authentication
  - Email uniqueness enforced
  - Password hash storage only
  - Account status management
- [x] Upload model with vector search
  - Processing state machine
  - pgvector integration ready
  - Similarity search methods
- [x] Clean imports in __init__.py

### Design Decisions (via ULTRATHINKING)
1. **Processing States**: More granular (analyzing/embedding) for better debugging
2. **UUID Generation**: Let PostgreSQL handle it for consistency
3. **Model Methods**: Class methods for queries, instance for mutations
4. **Vector Storage**: 1536 dimensions matching OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small

## 🎯 Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Password Hashing (`auth/password.py`)
```python
# Need to implement:
- hash_password(password: str) -> str
- verify_password(plain: str, hashed: str) -> bool
- Use bcrypt with 12 rounds minimum
```

### 2. JWT Authentication (`auth/jwt_auth.py`)
```python
# Need to implement:
- create_access_token(user_id: UUID) -> str
- decode_token(token: str) -> dict
- get_current_user dependency for FastAPI
```

### 3. Create Auth Routes (`routers/auth.py`)
```python
# Endpoints needed:
- POST /register
- POST /token (login)
- GET /me (current user)
```

---

## 💡 Important Context

### Model Architecture
- All database operations in models (MVC pattern)
- No SQLAlchemy - using raw asyncpg for performance
- Every method is async - no blocking operations
- Type hints on everything (modern Python 3.10+ style)

### Upload Processing Flow
1. Upload creates record with `pending` status
2. Background job updates to `analyzing` while Gemini processes
3. Updates to `embedding` while OpenAI creates vector
4. Final status: `completed` or `failed` with error message

### Security Notes
- Password hashes never exposed in to_dict()
- User email lookup is case-insensitive
- Proper foreign key constraints with CASCADE delete

## 🤖 Message to Next AI

Excellent foundation! The models are rock solid with:
- ✅ Full async/await support
- ✅ Proper type hints everywhere
- ✅ MVC pattern strictly followed
- ✅ Vector search ready to go

**Your immediate priority**: Get authentication working!
1. Start with password.py - simple bcrypt hashing
2. Then jwt_auth.py - token creation and validation
3. Finally auth routes to tie it together

The User model already has all the methods you need - just need to add the password hashing layer and JWT tokens. Remember to use the `config.settings` for JWT secret and expiration.

Keep using modern Python syntax and maintain the async pattern throughout! 🚀
