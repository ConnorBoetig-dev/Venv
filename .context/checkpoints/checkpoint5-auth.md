# Checkpoint 5 - Authentication System Complete

**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Previous Checkpoint**: checkpoint4-initial-models.md  
**Next AI Action**: Create Pydantic schemas in the schemas/ folder

---

## 🎯 Quick Start for Next AI

> **YOUR FIRST TASK**: Create the Pydantic schemas starting with `backend/schemas/auth.py`
> Then create user, upload, and search schemas in that order

---

## 📍 Current State Summary

Full authentication system is implemented with JWT access/refresh tokens and secure password hashing. Made the decision to use FastAPI's native patterns instead of Flask-style decorators after exploring both options. Ready to create schemas and then auth routes.

---

## 📂 Critical Files Created

### backend/settings.py
- **Purpose**: Application-wide constants
- **Key Items**:
  - Password hashing context (bcrypt 14 rounds)
  - Password validation constants
  - Future constants for processing

### backend/auth/password.py
- **Purpose**: Password hashing and validation
- **Features**:
  - Bcrypt with 14 rounds
  - Strong password requirements:
    - 8-69 chars (nice)
    - Must have: uppercase, lowercase, number, special char
  - Secure token generation

### backend/auth/jwt_auth.py
- **Purpose**: JWT token management  
- **Features**:
  - Dual-token system:
    - Access tokens: 30 minutes
    - Refresh tokens: 30 days
  - Minimal payload (just user_id)
  - FastAPI dependencies ready

### backend/exceptions.py & decorators.py
- **Created but DECIDED NOT TO USE**
- Explored Flask-style patterns but FastAPI's native way is better
- Keep files for reference but use Pydantic + Depends() instead

## ✅ What I Accomplished

### Completed
- [x] Password utilities with strong validation
  - Min 8, max 69 characters
  - Requires: uppercase + lowercase + number + special
  - Uses bcrypt with 14 rounds
- [x] JWT implementation with refresh tokens
  - Access token: 30 min (for API calls)
  - Refresh token: 30 days (to get new access)
  - Clean separation of concerns
- [x] Settings file for app constants
  - Separated from env config
  - Password rules centralized
- [x] Auth package with clean exports

### Decision Made
- **Rejected Flask-style decorators** in favor of FastAPI patterns
- Pydantic > manual JSON validation
- Explicit dependencies > hidden magic
- Built-in exception handling > custom classes

## 🎯 Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Create Schemas (`schemas/` folder)
```python
# Start with these files:
- schemas/__init__.py
- schemas/auth.py      # LoginRequest, TokenResponse
- schemas/user.py      # UserCreate, UserResponse  
- schemas/upload.py    # UploadCreate, UploadResponse
- schemas/search.py    # SearchRequest, SearchResult
```

### 2. Implement Auth Routes (`routers/auth.py`)
```python
# Endpoints needed:
- POST /register       # Create new user
- POST /token         # Login -> access + refresh tokens
- POST /token/refresh # Use refresh -> new access token
- GET /me            # Current user info
```

### 3. Create Main App (`main.py`)
```python
# Setup needed:
- FastAPI app instance
- CORS middleware
- Include routers
- Startup/shutdown events
```

---

## 💡 Important Context

### Password Requirements
- 8-69 characters
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one number (0-9)
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?)

### Token Strategy
- Access tokens for all API calls (30 min)
- Refresh tokens to get new access tokens (30 days)
- Refresh tokens don't regenerate - valid for full 30 days
- Both tokens returned on login

### FastAPI Patterns (Use These!)
```python
# Good - FastAPI way:
@router.post("/upload")
async def upload(
    data: UploadRequest,  # Pydantic validates!
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),  # Explicit!
):
    pass

# Bad - Don't use decorators:
@protected_endpoint()  # We built these but don't use them!
async def upload(...):
    pass
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Auth Functions

### Test Password Hashing
```python
from auth import hash_password, verify_password

# Should work
hashed = hash_password("MyStr0ng!Pass")
assert verify_password("MyStr0ng!Pass", hashed) == True

# Should fail validation
try:
    hash_password("weak")  # No uppercase, number, or special
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Password validation error
```

### Test JWT Creation
```python
from auth import create_token_pair
from uuid import uuid4

tokens = create_token_pair(uuid4())
print(tokens)  # {"access_token": "...", "refresh_token": "...", "token_type": "bearer"}
```

## 📋 Dependencies Installed
All from `pyproject.toml`:
- ✅ passlib[bcrypt] - Password hashing
- ✅ python-jose[cryptography] - JWT tokens
- ✅ All other dependencies from previous checkpoints

## 🤖 Message to Next AI

Excellent progress! The authentication foundation is rock solid. We explored Flask-style decorators but wisely decided to stick with FastAPI's superior patterns.

**Your immediate priorities**:
1. Create all Pydantic schemas (start with auth.py)
2. Implement the auth routes using those schemas
3. Wire everything up in main.py

Remember:
- Use Pydantic for ALL request/response validation
- Use `Depends(get_current_user)` explicitly in routes
- Let FastAPI handle exceptions automatically
- Keep it simple - this is an MVP!

The auth system supports both access and refresh tokens, so users stay logged in for 30 days. Password validation is strict but reasonable. Everything is async and properly typed.

You're building on a solid foundation - just follow FastAPI patterns and you'll have a working app quickly! 🚀
