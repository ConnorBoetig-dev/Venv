# Checkpoint 7 - Auth Routes, Main App, and Health Checks

**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Previous Checkpoint**: checkpoint6-schemas.md  
**Next AI Action**: Create upload routes and storage service

---

## 🎯 Quick Start for Next AI

> **YOUR FIRST TASK**: Test the app is working by running:
> ```bash
> cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload
> ```
> Then visit http://localhost:8000/docs to see the API documentation

## 📍 Current State Summary

The FastAPI application is now fully bootstrapped with authentication endpoints, rate limiting, health checks, and proper error handling. The app has a solid foundation with database lifecycle management, CORS configuration, and request tracking. Ready to add the core upload and search functionality.

---

## 📂 Critical Files Created

### backend/routers/auth.py
- **Purpose**: Authentication endpoints
- **Endpoints**:
  - POST `/api/auth/register` - User registration (3/min rate limit)
  - POST `/api/auth/token` - OAuth2 login (5/min rate limit)
  - POST `/api/auth/token/refresh` - Refresh tokens (10/min)
  - GET `/api/auth/me` - Current user info (30/min)
- **Features**: Rate limiting with slowapi, OAuth2 standard compliance

### backend/main.py
- **Purpose**: Main FastAPI application
- **Features**:
  - Lifespan management for DB connections
  - Exception handlers (validation, rate limits, global)
  - CORS middleware configured
  - Request ID tracking middleware
  - Environment-aware (hides docs in production)
  - Root endpoint with API info

### backend/routers/health.py
- **Purpose**: Health check endpoints
- **Endpoints**:
  - GET `/api/health` - Main health check
  - GET `/api/health/ready` - Readiness probe
  - GET `/api/health/live` - Liveness probe
- **Features**: Kubernetes-compatible probes

### backend/routers/__init__.py
- **Purpose**: Proper router exports

---

## ✅ What I Accomplished

### Completed
- [x] Auth routes with all 4 endpoints
  - OAuth2 standard `/token` endpoint (not custom JSON)
  - Rate limiting using slowapi (just like flask-limiter!)
  - Email normalization kept in model layer
- [x] Main application setup
  - Clean startup/shutdown with lifespan
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Request tracking with unique IDs
  - CORS properly configured
- [x] Health check router
  - Three types of health checks
  - Database connectivity verification
  - Ready for monitoring tools

### Key Decisions Made
1. **OAuth2 only** - Removed JSON login endpoint for standards compliance
2. **Slowapi for rate limiting** - Simple decorator-based like Flask
3. **All routes under /api** - Clean API structure
4. **Health checks separated** - Moved from main.py to dedicated router

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Upload Routes (`routers/upload.py`)
```python
# Endpoints needed:
- POST /api/uploads - File upload
- GET /api/uploads - List user's uploads  
- GET /api/uploads/{id} - Get single upload
- DELETE /api/uploads/{id} - Delete upload
```

### 2. Storage Service (`services/storage_service.py`)
```python
# Functionality needed:
- Save files to local storage
- Generate unique file paths
- Create thumbnails for images
- Extract frames from videos
```

### 3. Upload Flow Implementation
The upload process should:
1. Accept multipart/form-data
2. Validate file type/size
3. Save to disk via storage service
4. Create database record
5. Return upload response

---

## 💡 Important Context

### Rate Limiting
Using slowapi decorators:
- `/register`: 3/minute (strict)
- `/token`: 5/minute (reasonable)
- `/token/refresh`: 10/minute (automated)
- `/me`: 30/minute (authenticated)

### API Structure
All endpoints under `/api`:
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication
- `/api/health/*` - Health checks
- `/api/uploads/*` - File uploads (next)
- `/api/search/*` - Search (later)

### Middleware Stack
1. CORS (configured from settings)
2. Request ID injection
3. Request/response logging
4. Rate limiting (per endpoint)

---

## 🧪 Testing the Current State

### 1. Start the App
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Check Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

### 3. Register a User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "Test123!Pass"}'
```

### 4. Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=test@example.com&password=Test123!Pass"
```

## 📋 Dependencies Added
- ✅ slowapi (0.1.9) - Rate limiting

---

## 🤖 Message to Next AI

Excellent progress! The foundation is rock solid:
- ✅ Auth system with JWT tokens
- ✅ Rate limiting in place
- ✅ Health checks ready
- ✅ Main app properly configured

**Your priorities**:
1. Create upload routes with multipart/form-data handling
2. Build the storage service for local file management
3. Remember to validate file types and sizes!

The auth system works great - test it via the docs at `/docs`. All the infrastructure is ready, now we need the core functionality!

Keep following the FastAPI patterns - use Depends() for auth, Pydantic for validation, and maintain the async pattern throughout. You've got this! 🚀
