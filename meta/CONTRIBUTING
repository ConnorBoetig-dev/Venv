# Contributing to PG-VENV

First off, thank you for considering contributing to PG-VENV!

We welcome any type of contribution, not just code. You can help with:
*   **Reporting a bug**
*   **Discussing the current state of the code**
*   **Submitting a fix**
*   **Proposing new features**
*   **Becoming a maintainer**

## Getting Started

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `PG-VENV` for local development.

1.  **Fork the repository.** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the [PG-VENV](https://github.com/ConnorBoetig-dev/Venv). This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

2.  **Clone your fork.** Now, clone the forked repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ConnorBoetig-dev/Venv.git
    ```

3.  **Create a new branch.** It's important to create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your main branch clean and makes it easier to manage multiple contributions.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-descriptive-branch-name
    ```
    (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/add-new-button` or `git checkout -b fix/login-bug`)

4.  **Make your changes.** Now you can make your changes to the code, documentation, or whatever you're contributing.

5.  **Commit your changes.** Once you're happy with your changes, commit them with a clear and descriptive commit message.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Describe your change in a concise way"
    ```

6.  **Push your changes to your fork.**

    ```bash
    git push origin your-descriptive-branch-name
    ```

7.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR).** Go to your fork on GitHub. You should see a "Compare & pull request" button. Click it to create a new pull request.

    -   Provide a clear title for your PR.
    -   In the description, explain the "what" and "why" of your changes.
    -   Link to any relevant issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").
    -   Ensure any CI checks are passing.

Once you submit your PR, a project maintainer will review your changes. We may suggest some changes or improvements or ask for more information. We'll do our best to provide timely feedback.

Thank you for your contribution!
